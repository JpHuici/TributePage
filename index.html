            <h2>About Edgar Allan Poe </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Edgar Allan Poe lost his parents, traveling actors, when he was only two years old. Little Edgar was raised by John Allan, a wealthy Richmond businessman.</li>
              <li>From 1815 to 1820 he lived with John Allan and his wife in the United Kingdom, where he began his education.</li>
              <li>After returning to the United States, he continued studying in private schools and attended the University of Virginia, but in 1827 his fondness for gambling and drinking led to his expulsion. He soon afterward abandoned the clerkship assigned to him by his adoptive father, and traveled to Boston, where he anonymously published his first book, "Tamerlane and Other Poems" (Tamerlane and Other Poems, 1827).</li>
              <li>He then enlisted in the army, where he remained for two years. In 1829 his second book of poems, "Al Aaraaf", appeared and he obtained, through the influence of his adoptive father, a position at the West Point Military Academy, from which a few months later he was expelled for neglect of duty.</li>
              <li>In 1832, and after the publication of his third book, "Poems by Edgar Allan Poe" (Poems by Edgar Allan Poe, 1831), he moved to Baltimore, where he married his cousin Virginia Clemm, who was then thirteen years old. Around this time he became editor of the Southern Baltimore Messenger newspaper, in which he wrote several of his stories and poems, and which under his direction would become the most important newspaper in the southern part of the country. Later he contributed to several magazines in Philadelphia and New York, the city where he had settled with his wife in 1837.</li>
              <li>His work as an incisive and often scandalous literary critic earned him a certain notoriety, and his original appreciations about the tale and the nature of poetry would not cease to gain influence over time. In 1840 he published in Philadelphia "Tales of the Grotesque and the Arabesque"; then he obtained an extraordinary success with "The Gold Bug" (1843), a story about a fabulous buried treasure, as emblematic of his writing as the collection of poems "The Raven and Other Poems" (1845), which brought his literary reputation to the top.</li>
              <li>His wife's long illness turned his marriage into a bitter experience; when she died in 1847, his tendency to alcoholism and drug use worsened, according to the testimony of his contemporaries. Both addictions were, in all probability, the cause of his death, which occurred in 1849: he was found unconscious on a Baltimore street and taken to a hospital, where he died a few days later, apparently of a stroke.</li>

          <h2>The work of Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
          <!--article text-->
            <article id="article">
              <p>The quality of Poe's literary production has partly obscured his facet as a literary theorist; in works such as "Fundamento del verso" (1843), "La filosofía de la composición" (1846) and "El principio poético" (1850), he expounded singular and novel ideas on literary genres and the process of creation. In the latter field, he completely departed from the romantic concept of inspiration by advocating a thoughtful, meditated and perfectly conscious writing of the expressive techniques, which had to be channeled in the direction of the desired effect. Such ideas were to have a great influence among the anti-romantic critics.</p>
              <p>Regarding genres, Poe maintained that the highest literary expression is poetry, and he devoted his greatest efforts to it. His poems were not well received by American critics, who considered them excessively artificial, but, after Mallarmé's studies, Europeans saw in Poe a model precursor of symbolism. The appreciation is fair if we do not forget the romantic motifs that, despite his poetics, still weighed down his verses.</p>
              <p>The Byronic fashion left its mark in a first book he published when he was only eighteen, "Tamerlane and Other Poems" (1827). In his second work, "Al Aaraaf" (1829), the poet celebrates an ethereal form of beauty, a prelude to the pure "ideality" to which he would aspire in some later poems. In his third book, "Poems" (1831), he brought together with some revisions and additions the poems of the first two volumes, and added six new compositions. In them he reached maturity and found an authentic voice, although the echo of Coleridge can be discerned in it; his evocation of an ideal and visionary world was enhanced by the hypnotic rhythm of the verses and the disturbing force of the images.</p>
              <p>His last book, "The Raven and Other Poems" (1845), is the expression of his pessimism and his longing for an unworldly beauty. Some of Poe's compositions, detached from the collections of poems of which they are part, reached a remarkable popularity. His long poem "The Raven" (The Raven, 1845) is justly famous, where his mastery of rhythm and the sonority of the verse reach the highest level. "The Bells" (1849), whose resonance, which accompanies the various stages of human life from childhood to death, is evoked with rhymed reiterations and alliterations; "Ulalume" (1847), a journey from sadness to illusion that falls back into despair; and "Annabel Lee" (1849), exaltation of an innocent childish love that not even death can truncate.</p>
